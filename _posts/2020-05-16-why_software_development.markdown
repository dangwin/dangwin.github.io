Where Do I Start?

I have always been considered a "techy" in the house and enjoyed helping out with networking and computer related stuff when it was needed. My curiousity for coding and learning basic <html> and CSS started long ago. I picked up a few books from the local book store and would seriously try to learn the language. I was always intrigued by a new skill set that could speak to the computer and the computer can understand. Of course life got in the way but in the back of my mind I always had that urge to learn. 

Fast Forward

I always welcome challeges and finding the best and most efficient solution to anything. I am starting my 2nd week of Flatiron School and I have to say the challenges are there. From debugging to seeing what the errors are, I am constantly challeged in a totally new and uncomfortable enviorment. However, in the midst of the struggles, I find myself enjoying the process. Taking in every moment of it and savoring it. I can truly say that there is a satisfaction that comes out of finally being able to figure out how to do a lab and getting the green light that everything had passed. 

So Why?

Software Development I believe will give me a challenge that I yearn for. Whenever I am presented with a question about code, it usually comes in the form of - here is the starting code. We want you to figure out how to make it do such and such (the end-goal). As software developers, that's where we come in. We are there to figure out and fill in that space in between the beginning and the end-goal. Although in the past 2 weeks I have struggled with coding, I have found that I have learned a lot and have grown as a developer. I am quicker to debug and see where the common issues are in my code. I always am looking for challenges and can't wait for what's in store.
